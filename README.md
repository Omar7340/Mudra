# Dataset Generator Helper

A tool designed for sign language recognition using machine learning.

## Overview

This project consists of three main modules:
1. Dataset Generator: Creates and manages sign language gesture datasets
2. Model Trainer: Trains machine learning models for sign language recognition
3. Recognition Module: Deploys trained models for real-time sign language interpretation
